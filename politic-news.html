       <p>
        During his campaign for the presidency, Joe Biden vowed to restore U.S. participation in the Iran nuclear<br> 
        deal, which he said Donald Trump had “recklessly tossed away.” And after more than a year of negotiations<br>
        hobbled by deadlocks and delays,there appeared on Monday to be signs of progress when Iran responded to what <br>
        European Union officials described as the “final text” of an updated agreement. But the breakthrough,such as it is,<br>
        comes just a few days after the stabbing of the novelist Salman Rushdie, who has faced threats ever since <br>
         Iranian leadership called for his death in 1989.Tehran has denied any involvement in the attack last week<br>
        but nonetheless blamed Rushdie for it,prompting Secretary of State Antony Blinken to denounce the Iranian government’s <br>
        incitement of violence against Rushdie as “despicable.” Some high-profile Republicans have gone further, calling on <br>
        the White House to cut off all diplomatic engagement with Iran.</p><hr>

        <p>
            WASHINGTON — The Department of Justice charged an Iranian military operative on Wednesday <br>
            with plotting to assassinate former President Donald Trump’s national security advisor John<br>
            Bolton.Shahram Poursafi, 45,of Tehran, Iran, tried to arrange the killing of Bolton in <br>
            retaliation for the January 2020< U.S. airstrikethat killed Iran’s top commander, Gen.<br>
            Qasem Soleimani,according to court documents. Soleimani, who led a special forces unit<br>
            of Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guard, had been a key figure in Iranian and Middle East<br>
            politics and his death exacerbated already-high tensions between Iran and the United States<br> 
            and triggered concerns of retaliation from Iranian forces. Bolton,who served as Trump’s third <br>
            national security advisor for 17 months before resigning, was the main architect of the administration’s<br>
            “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran. Bolton favored escalating economic sanctions and threats<br>
            of retaliation for Iran’s malign behavior.Poursafi, a member of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard and<br>
            working on behalf of the group, attempted to pay individuals in the United States in October<br>
            2021 a reward of $300,000 to carry out the plot in either Washington, D.C., or Maryland.Poursafi<br>
            told one person in contact about the job that it did not matter how the murder was carried out<br>
            but that he would need video confirmation of Bolton’s death. He asked the person multiple times<br>
            when the murder would be carried out and informed the person that it needed to be done quickly.<br>
            Poursafi, also known as Mehdi Rezayi, was charged with the use of interstate commerce facilities<br>
            in the commission of murder for hire  and with providing and attempting to provide material support<br>
            to a transnational murder plot.</p>

            <h3>Putin’s trip to Iran shows Russia’s ‘desperation,’ says U.S. Institute of Peace</h3>

                Putin also met with Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Iran.<br>
                “I think the Russians would spin the meeting as a demonstration that they’re<br>
                not actually isolated, they’re still a major player in the Middle East,” he told<br>
                CNBC’s “Squawk Box Asia” on Wednesday. “But I do think, to [National Security Council <br>
                spokesman John Kirby’s] point, it does show a bit of desperation that the Russians are<br>
                having to go to the Iranians for military support,” he added. Earlier, Kirby told reporters<br>
                at the White House that the trip “shows the degree to which Mr. Putin and Russia are increasingly isolated.”<br>
                “Now they have to turn to Iran for help,” he said.Russia’s press service and information department did not <br>
                immediately respond to CNBC’s request for comment.

        <details><summary>Interest in Iranian drones</summary>
         The White House said Russian officials have viewed weapons-capable drones in Iran that Moscow<br>
         may want to acquire for its war in Ukraine.Speaking at the Aspen Security Forum on Wednesday,<br>
         CIA Director William Burns said Russia’s interest in Iranian drones is a reflection of<br>
         “the deficiencies of Russia’s defense industry today, the difficulties they’re having after<br>
         significant losses so far in the war against Ukraine and replenishing their stocks as well.”<br>
         “Russians and Iranians need each other right now. Both heavily sanctioned countries, both looking <br>
         to break out of  political isolation as well,” he added.Burns said the countries want to help <br>
         each other evade sanctions and show they have options, but there are limits to how much they can <br>
         cooperate.He said Tehran and Moscow  don’t really trust each other because they are energy rivals <br>
         and historical competitors.The competition over exporting sanctioned energy is a structural issue<br>
          that is preventing deep Russia-Iran relations, USIP’s Drennan said.<br>
