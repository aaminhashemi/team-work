        <h3>After the Rushdie Attack, Can the Iran Nuclear Deal Be Saved?</h3>

        <p>
            During his campaign for the presidency, Joe Biden vowed to restore U.S. participation in the Iran
            nuclear<br>
            deal, which he said Donald Trump had “recklessly tossed away.” And after more than a year of
            negotiations<br>
            hobbled by deadlocks and delays,there appeared on Monday to be signs of progress when Iran responded to what
            <br>
            European Union officials described as the “final text” of an updated agreement. But the breakthrough,such as
            it is,<br>
            comes just a few days after the stabbing of the novelist Salman Rushdie, who has faced threats ever since
            <br>
            Iranian leadership called for his death in 1989.Tehran has denied any involvement in the attack last
            week<br>
            but nonetheless blamed Rushdie for it,prompting Secretary of State Antony Blinken to denounce the Iranian
            government’s <br>
            incitement of violence against Rushdie as “despicable.” Some high-profile Republicans have gone further,
            calling on <br>
            the White House to cut off all diplomatic engagement with Iran.</p>

        <h3>U.S. charges Iranian military operative in plot to assassinate former Trump advisor John Bolton</h3>

        <p>
            WASHINGTON — The Department of Justice charged an Iranian military operative on Wednesday <br>
            with plotting to assassinate former President Donald Trump’s national security advisor John<br>
            Bolton.Shahram Poursafi, 45,of Tehran, Iran, tried to arrange the killing of Bolton in <br>
            retaliation for the January 2020< U.S. airstrikethat killed Iran’s top commander, Gen.<br>
                Qasem Soleimani,according to court documents. Soleimani, who led a special forces unit<br>
                of Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guard, had been a key figure in Iranian and Middle East<br>
                politics and his death exacerbated already-high tensions between Iran and the United States<br>
                and triggered concerns of retaliation from Iranian forces. Bolton,who served as Trump’s third <br>
                national security advisor for 17 months before resigning, was the main architect of the
                administration’s<br>
                “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran. Bolton favored escalating economic sanctions and threats<br>
                of retaliation for Iran’s malign behavior.Poursafi, a member of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard and<br>
                working on behalf of the group, attempted to pay individuals in the United States in October<br>
                2021 a reward of $300,000 to carry out the plot in either Washington, D.C., or Maryland.Poursafi<br>
                told one person in contact about the job that it did not matter how the murder was carried out<br>
                but that he would need video confirmation of Bolton’s death. He asked the person multiple times<br>
                when the murder would be carried out and informed the person that it needed to be done quickly.<br>
                Poursafi, also known as Mehdi Rezayi, was charged with the use of interstate commerce facilities<br>
                in the commission of murder for hire and with providing and attempting to provide material support<br>
                to a transnational murder plot.</p>

        <h3>Putin’s trip to Iran shows Russia’s ‘desperation,’ says U.S. Institute of Peace</h3>

        <p>
            Putin also met with Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Iran.<br>
            “I think the Russians would spin the meeting as a demonstration that they’re<br>
            not actually isolated, they’re still a major player in the Middle East,” he told<br>
            CNBC’s “Squawk Box Asia” on Wednesday. “But I do think, to [National Security Council <br>
            spokesman John Kirby’s] point, it does show a bit of desperation that the Russians are<br>
            having to go to the Iranians for military support,” he added. Earlier, Kirby told reporters<br>
            at the White House that the trip “shows the degree to which Mr. Putin and Russia are increasingly
            isolated.”<br>
            “Now they have to turn to Iran for help,” he said.Russia’s press service and information department did not
            <br>
            immediately respond to CNBC’s request for comment.

            <summary>Interest in Iranian drones</summary>
            The White House said Russian officials have viewed weapons-capable drones in Iran that Moscow<br>
            may want to acquire for its war in Ukraine.Speaking at the Aspen Security Forum on Wednesday,<br>
            CIA Director William Burns said Russia’s interest in Iranian drones is a reflection of<br>
            “the deficiencies of Russia’s defense industry today, the difficulties they’re having after<br>
            significant losses so far in the war against Ukraine and replenishing their stocks as well.”<br>
            “Russians and Iranians need each other right now. Both heavily sanctioned countries, both looking <br>
            to break out of political isolation as well,” he added.Burns said the countries want to help <br>
            each other evade sanctions and show they have options, but there are limits to how much they can <br>
            cooperate.He said Tehran and Moscow don’t really trust each other because they are energy rivals <br>
            and historical competitors.The competition over exporting sanctioned energy is a structural issue<br>
            that is preventing deep Russia-Iran relations, USIP’s Drennan said.<br>

            <h3>Europeans divided over how Ukraine war should play out, reveals poll </h3>

            <p>
                Europeans are sharply divided over how the Ukraine war should play out,<br>
                with some favouring peace and others wanting "justice", according to a new poll.<br>
                The European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR) survey of 10 countries showed that 35% of<br>
                Europeans were in the "peace camp", favouring an end to the war as soon as possible. <br>
                Meanwhile, 22% of respondents wanted "justice", punishing Russia for its invasion <br>
                and restoring Ukraine's territory.Moscow has steadfastly rejected claims it is a war,<br>
                insisting on calling it a "special military operation".Poland, which borders Ukraine<br>
                and has been very supportive of Kyiv, had the most respondents wanting "justice" <br>
                against Russia of those surveyed.Italy, Germany and Romania had the most favouring<br>
                a peaceful end to hostilities.<br>
